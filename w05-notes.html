    Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions. Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown. The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code. Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement. An error object is created when an exception occurs. Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur. Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented. The Jest framework can be used to test your code.

    The ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function syntax because they are more succinct, easier to read and all code in a class definition is implicitly in strict mode, so doesn&#39;t need the &#39;use strict&#39; statement.

    The __proto__ property was formalized in ES6 because it was already implemented in most browsers, and many JavaScript libraries already used it. It is not considered part of the official specification, and it’s recommended that getPrototypeOf() is used instead.

    is possible to do this if constructor functions are used, and it can cause a lot of headaches if you accidentally redefine the prototype. This is because any instances that have already been created will retain the properties and methods of the old prototype, but will not receive any of the new properties and methods that are subsequently added to the redefined prototype. This is another reason why it’s recommended to use class declarations instead of constructor functions.
