Custom Properties There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript. For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it does:

If a variable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later in the code. Even worse, the name of the variable may clash with another piece of code (an external JavaScript library, for example) resulting in errors. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. The example that follows uses an IIFE to swap the value of two global variables, a and b. This process requires the use of a temporary variable, called temp, which only exists while the IIFE is invoked:

Initialization Code An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable, named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary. An IIFE will be invoked once, and can set up any variables, objects and event handlers when the page loads.

<div class="noteText">
Functional programming has gained momentum in recent years, with a dedicated following. The popularity of purely functional languages, such as Clojure, Scala and Erlang, sparked an interest in functional programming techniques that continues to grow. JavaScript has always supported functional-style programming due to functions being first-class objects. The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming that JavaScript excels at.

Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added. All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values. Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions. A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met. A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function. Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed. Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors. Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.

<div class="noteText">
A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in. A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword. A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function. Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions. Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency). Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.

Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

The __proto__ property was formalized in ES6 because it was already implemented in most browsers, and many JavaScript libraries already used it. It is not considered part of the official specification, and it’s recommended that getPrototypeOf() is used instead.

is possible to do this if constructor functions are used, and it can cause a lot of headaches if you accidentally redefine the prototype. This is because any instances that have already been created will retain the properties and methods of the old prototype, but will not receive any of the new properties and methods that are subsequently added to the redefined prototype. This is another reason why it’s recommended to use class declarations instead of constructor functions.

It has since been superseded by the Fetch API, which is currently a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network. The Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.

JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. Here is an example of how a JSON response promise would be resolved: fetch(url) .then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) ) .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error)) Again, this is very similar to the earlier examples, except this response returns some JSON data that is then resolved as a JavaScript object. This means we can manipulate the object using JavaScript. In the example below, the Object.entries() method is used to view the key and value pairs in the returned object.

GET requests to retrieve resources POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource DELETE requests to delete a resources. By default, a link in a web page will make a GET request. Forms are also submitted using a GET request by default, but they will often use a POST request. This excellent blog post by Rob Miller explains each of these verbs in more depth if you're interested in learning more about them.
